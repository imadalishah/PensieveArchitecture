Open a new notebook on Google Colab.\n","2. Set the runtime type to Python 3.8.\n","3. Install the required dependencies using the following command:\n","   `!pip install tensorflow tflearn matplotlib selenium`\n","4. Clone the Pensieve repository from My [GoogleDrive](https:////drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LAkFiMLk85r_rfcbf_mBSRyR1tmvBAcX?usp=share_link) to your drive \n","5. Change the working directory to the Pensieve repository:\n","   `%cd /content/drive/MyDrive/pensieve`\n","6. Put the training data in the 'sim/cooked_traces' folder and testing data in the 'sim/cooked_test_traces' folder.\n","7. Run the '`!python sim/get_video_sizes.py`'\n","8. Train a new model by running the '`!python sim/multi_agent.py`'\n","9. Monitor the testing curve of rewards, entropy, and TD loss by launching Tensorboard from the terminal: by running '`!tensorboard --logdir=sim/`'\n","10. To test the trained model in a simulated environment, copy over the model to test/models and modify the NN_MODEL field in test/rl_no_training.py. Then, run the '`!python test/get_video_sizes.py`'\n","11. Run the '`!python test/rl_no_training.py`' script\n","12. To run experiments over Mahimahi emulated network, copy over the trained model to rl_server/results and modify the NN_MODEL field in rl_server/rl_server_no_training.py. Then, run the '`!python run_exp/run_all_traces.py`' script\n","13. To run real-world experiments, first set up a server (setup.py automatically installs an Apache server and put needed files in /var/www/html). Then, copy over the trained model to rl_server/results and modify the NN_MODEL field in rl_server/rl_server_no_training.py. Next, modify the url field in real_exp/run_video.py to the server URL. Finally, run the '`!python real_exp/run_exp.py`' script\n","14. To view the training and cross-validation (testing) curve using Tensorboard, run '`!tensorboard --logdir=sim/`'\n","15.
